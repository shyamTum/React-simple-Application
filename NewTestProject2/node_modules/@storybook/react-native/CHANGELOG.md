## v1.0.0

This is the initial non-poc release of `react-native-storybook`. With this release, users can write stories and check them using an ios-simulator. The address of the storybook `localhost:9001` is hardcoded so for now it does not work on real devices or the android simulator. Also it is not contributor friendly. When used with `npm link`, the node_modules directory should be removed when using the ios simulator.

-   Support ability to write stories using `storiesOf` and `add` without using decorators or addons
-   The storybook can be started with `storybook start -h localhost -p 9001` although the port and host should be as given in this example
-   The story preview device can be started with the `react-native run-ios` command but the apps `index.*.js` must be edited (for now)
